Installing Packages and Preparing VPN Servers

Usually, you will be managing site-A only, but based on the requirements, you could be managing both site-A and site-B. We start the process by installing Openswan.

On Red Hat based Systems (CentOS, Fedora or RHEL):

# yum install openswan lsof
On Debian based Systems (Debian, Ubuntu or Linux Mint):

# apt-get install openswan
Now we disable VPN redirects, if any, in the server using these commands:

# for vpn in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*; 
# do echo 0 > $vpn/accept_redirects; 
# echo 0 > $vpn/send_redirects; 
# done
Next, we modify the kernel parameters to allow IP forwarding and disable redirects permanently.

# vim /etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
Reload /etc/sysctl.conf:

# sysctl -p
We allow necessary ports in the firewall. Please make sure that the rules are not conflicting with existing firewall rules.

# iptables  -A INPUT  -p udp  --dport 500  -j ACCEPT
# iptables  -A INPUT  -p tcp  --dport 4500  -j ACCEPT
# iptables  -A INPUT  -p udp  --dport 4500  -j ACCEPT
Finally, we create firewall rules for NAT.

# iptables   -t nat   -A POSTROUTING   -s site-A-private-subnet   -d site-B-private-subnet   -j SNAT --to site-A-Public-IP
Please make sure that the firewall rules are persistent.

Note:

You could use MASQUERADE instead of SNAT. Logically it should work, but it caused me to have issues with virtual private servers (VPS) in the past. So I would use SNAT if I were you.
If you are managing site-B as well, create similar rules in site-B server.
Direct routing does not need SNAT.
Preparing Configuration Files



The first configuration file that we will work with is ipsec.conf. Regardless of which server you are configuring, always consider your site as left and remote site as right. The following configuration is done in siteA's VPN server.

# vim /etc/ipsec.conf
## general configuration parameters ##

config setup
        plutodebug=all
        plutostderrlog=/var/log/pluto.log
        protostack=netkey
        nat_traversal=yes
        virtual_private=%v4:10.0.0.0/8,%v4:192.168.0.0/16,%v4:172.16.0.0/12
        ## disable opportunistic encryption in Red Hat ##
        oe=off

## disable opportunistic encryption in Debian ##
## Note: this is a separate declaration statement ##
include /etc/ipsec.d/examples/no_oe.conf

        leftnexthop=%defaultroute
        right=<siteB-public-IP>
        rightsubnet=<siteB-private-subnet>/netmask
Authentication can be done in several different ways. This tutorial will cover the use of pre-shared key, which is added to the file /etc/ipsec.secrets.

# vim /etc/ipsec.secrets
siteA-public-IP  siteB-public-IP:  PSK  "pre-shared-key"
## in case of multiple sites ##
siteA-public-IP  siteC-public-IP:  PSK  "corresponding-pre-shared-key"
Starting the Service and Troubleshooting

The server should now be ready to create a site-to-site VPN tunnel. If you are managing site-B as well, please make sure that you have configured the site-B's server with necessary parameters. For Red Hat based systems, please make sure that you add the service into startup using chkconfig command.

# /etc/init.d/ipsec restart
If there are no errors in both end servers, the tunnel should be up now. Taking the following into consideration, you can test the tunnel with ping command.

The site-B's private subnet should not be reachable from site-A. I.e., ping should not work if the tunnel is not up.
After the tunnel is up, try ping to site-B's private subnet from site-A. This should work.
Also, the routes to the destination's private subnet should appear in the server's routing table.

# ip route
[site-B's private-subnet] via [siteA-gateway] dev eth0 src [siteA-public-IP]
default via [site-A's gateway] dev eth0
Additionally, we can check the status of the tunnel using the following useful commands.

# service ipsec status
IPsec running  - pluto pid: 20754
pluto pid 20754
1 tunnels up
some eroutes exist
# ipsec auto --status

The log file /var/log/pluto.log should also contain useful information regarding authentication, key exchanges and information on different phases of the tunnel. If your tunnel doesn't come up, you could check there as well.

If you are sure that all the configuration is correct, and if your tunnel is still not coming up, you should check the following things.

Many ISPs filter IPsec ports. Make sure that UDP/500, TCP/UDP/4500 ports are allowed by your ISP. You could try connecting to your server IPsec ports from a remote location by telnet.
Make sure that necessary ports are allowed in the firewall of the servers.
Make sure that the pre-shared keys are identical in both end servers.
The left and right parameters should be properly configured on both end servers.
If you are facing problems with NAT, try using SNAT instead of MASQUERADING.
To sum up, this tutorial focused on the procedure of creating a site-to-site IPSec VPN tunnel in Linux using Openswan. VPN tunnels are very useful in enhancing security as they allow admins to make critical resources available only through the tunnels. Also VPN tunnels ensure that the data in transit is secured from eavesdropping or interception.

Hope this helps. Let me know what you think.
